In proof-based verifiable computation, many systems have been built that faithfully represent the semantics of imperative programs in constraints (buffet, pequin, xjsnark, circ).
However, these systems still suffer from prohibitively high costs for generating proofs, driven by the high number of constraints they output.
This is due in part to the representation of branching instructions and permutations in constraints, currently compiled to constraints that nullify unused branches and permutation networks respectively.
To address the high number of constraints generated and bring proof-based verifiable computation of imperative programs closer to reality, this paper introduces \textit{binning networks},
a new primitive based on arithmetic constraints that more succinctly represent partitioning into disjoint sets than permutation networks. This paper then uses this construction
for amortized improvements in the compilation of branching and recursion to constraints.
