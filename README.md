This repository exists to colect notes, papers, and ideas for improving the compilation of control flow structures using binning.

Project goals:
Rewriting iterated conditionals to use binning networks knowing a bound/ratio on the number of times each branch is taken,
and counting/bounding the number of times each branch is taken automatically

# Rewriting Iterated Conditionals to Bin
We wish to rewrite iterated conditionals, knowing the number of true and false cases, to binning constructs.
## Tasks
## Papers

# Counting/Bounding the number of times each branch is taken
We wish to, as an extension of the project, bound the number of times each branch is taken.
